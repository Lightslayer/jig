+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Man: Ah. I'd like to have an argument, please.
+
+Receptionist: Certainly sir. Have you been here before?
+
+Man: No, I haven't, this is my first time.
+
+Receptionist: I see. Well, do you want to have just one argument, or were you thinking of taking a course?
+
+Man: Well, what is the cost?
+
+Receptionist: Well, It's one pound for a five minute argument, but only eight pounds for a course of ten.
+
+Man: Well, I think it would be best if I perhaps started off with just the one and then see how it goes.
