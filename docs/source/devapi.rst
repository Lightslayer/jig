Hacking on Jig and internal API
===============================

Tests and coverage
------------------

Jig uses `Nose`_ to run tests and `coverage.py`_ to perform code coverage
analysis.

You need to have a cloned copy of Jig to run either one. You can start with a
read-only copy:

::

    $ git clone git://github.com/robmadole/jig.git

Or `fork the repository`_ on GitHub to make your own changes. The
:doc:`Jig License <license>` is friendly.

.. _development-buildout:

Jig also uses zc.buildout, which means you need to run a couple of commands to
download dependencies and create the scripts needed for development.

::

    $ python boostrap.py && ./bin/buildout

To run the tests:

::

    $ ./bin/jig-tests

To run test coverage:

::

    $ ./bin/jig-coverage

.. _Nose: http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/
.. _coverage.py: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/
.. _fork the repository: https://github.com/robmadole/jig/fork_select

Making the documentation
------------------------

This documentation is made with Sphinx_. To build the docs make sure you've ran
the :ref:`buildout <development-buildout>` first.


Build the HTML version:

::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

The builds will be placed in :file:`build`.

Plumbing of Jig
---------------

How it hooks in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you run :ref:`jig init <cli-init>` on a Git repository it does two basic things.

First it creates a :file:`$GIT_REPO/.git/hooks/pre-commit` file and makes it executable.

The file looks something like this:

::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from sys import path
    from os.path import dirname, join

    # Make sure that we can find the directory that jig is installed
    # ... (various path modifications, don't look behind the curtain)

    from jig.runner import Runner

    # Start up the runner, passing in the repo directory
    jig = Runner()
    jig.fromhook(join(dirname(__file__), '..', '..'))

This is really just a redirection of control to the :py:class:`Runner` object.
It does all the work.

Secondly, it creates a :file:`$GIT_REPO/.jig` directory with a :file:`plugins`
directory and an empty :file:`plugins.cfg` configuration file within it.

As you :ref:`install plugins <cli-plugin-add>` the configuration file will get
modified to includes bits of information about whatever plugin you install.

When you install plugins from a URL, the plugin will be cloned for you
automatically and then placed in the :file:`.jig/plugins` directory.

If we installed the following plugin by running ``jig plugin install http://github.com/myusername/myplugin`` it would be saved in a directory similar to this.
:file:`.jig/plugins/24a8056749e448b182d44690a04ca0b7/myplugin`.

The configuration file :file:`plugins.cfg` will now contain a reference to this
location.

::

  [plugin:mybundle:myplugin]
  path = ./.jig/plugins/24a8056749e448b182d44690a04ca0b7/myplugin
  crank_widget = yes

It also contains the **default settings** for this plugin as defined by the
author. You can change these settings to affect the way the plugin behaves.

How it runs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Git automatically runs Jig when ``git commit`` is ran. It happens before your
staged files become an object in the Git database (before your commit is
written).

The neat part of this is that **if Jig returns an exit code of 0** the commit
will occur. But **if Jig returns a non-zero exit code like 1**, Git will abort the
commit.

Jig communicates with plugins using the `JSON`_ data format. Both the input and
the output are JSON.

A plugin has the ability to pass messages back to Jig that will be formatted
and displayed in the terminal.
