(Cut to a night school Teacher looking down out of classroom window. He
crosses to a long wall blackboard with line of pigs drawn on near end.
He crosses one off, walks along blackboard to other end which has
written on it 'evening classes 7-8p.m. '. He writes 'Italian' below this
and turns to camera.) Teacher: Ah - good evening everyone, and welcome
to the second of our Italian language classes, in which we'll be helping
you brush up your Italian. Last week we started at the beginning, and we
learnt the Italian for a 'spoon'. Now, I wonder how many of you can
remember what it was?

(Shout of 'Si, Si, Si,' from the class whom we see are all Italians.)

Teacher: Not all at once ... sit down Mario. Giuseppe!

Giuseppe: II cucchiaio.

Teacher: Well done Giuseppe, or, as the Italians would say: 'Molto bene,
Giuseppe'.

Giuseppe: Grazie signor ... grazie di tutta la sua gentilezza.

Teacher: Well, now, this week we're going to learn some useful phrases
to help us open a conversation with an Italian. Now first of all try
telling him where you come from. For example, I would say: 'Sono Inglese
di Gerrard's Cross', I am an Englishman from Gerrard's Cross. Shall we
all try that together?
