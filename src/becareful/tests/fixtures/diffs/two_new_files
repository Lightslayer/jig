+Italian Lesson
+==============
+
+The cast:
+~~~~~~~~~
+
+TEACHER
+  Terry Jones
+GIUSEPPE
+  Michael Palin
+MARIOLINI
+  John Cleese
+FRANCESCO
+  Eric Idle
+HELMUT
+  Graham Chapman
+
+The sketch:
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+(Cut to a night school Teacher looking down out of classroom window. He
+crosses to a long wall blackboard with line of pigs drawn on near end.
+He crosses one off, walks along blackboard to other end which has
+written on it 'evening classes 7-8p.m. '. He writes 'Italian' below this
+and turns to camera.) Teacher: Ah - good evening everyone, and welcome
+to the second of our Italian language classes, in which we'll be helping
+you brush up your Italian. Last week we started at the beginning, and we
+learnt the Italian for a 'spoon'. Now, I wonder how many of you can
+remember what it was?
+
+(Shout of 'Si, Si, Si,' from the class whom we see are all Italians.)
+
+Teacher: Not all at once ... sit down Mario. Giuseppe!
+
+Giuseppe: II cucchiaio.
+
+Teacher: Well done Giuseppe, or, as the Italians would say: 'Molto bene,
+Giuseppe'.
+
+Giuseppe: Grazie signor ... grazie di tutta la sua gentilezza.
+
+Teacher: Well, now, this week we're going to learn some useful phrases
+to help us open a conversation with an Italian. Now first of all try
+telling him where you come from. For example, I would say: 'Sono Inglese
+di Gerrard's Cross', I am an Englishman from Gerrard's Cross. Shall we
+all try that together?
