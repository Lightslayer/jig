The sketch:
~~~~~~~~~~~

(Opening Scene: Mozart sitting at piano tinkling with the keys. He
finishes tinkling.) Mozart: Hello again, and welcome to the show.
Tonight we continue to look at some famous deaths. Tonight we start with
the wonderful death of Genghis Khan, conqueror of India. Take it away
Genghis.

(Cut to Genghis Khan's tent. Genghis strides about purposefully.
Indian-style background music. Suddenly the music cuts out and Genghis
Khan with a squawk throws himself in the air and lands on his back. This
happens very suddenly. Judges hold up cards with points on, in the
manner of ice skating judges.)

Voice Over: 9.1, 9.3, 9.7, that's 28.1 for Genghis Khan.

(Mozart still at piano.)

Mozart: Bad luck Genghis. Nice to have you on the show. And now here are
the scores.

(Scoreboard with Eddie Waring figure stnding by it. The scoreboard looks
a little like this:)
