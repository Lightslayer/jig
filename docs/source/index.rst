What is Jig
===========

Jig is a Git pre-commit hook on steroids. It abstracts some of the messier
manual bits away and lets you get down to business.

`Git Hooks`_ are little scripts that you can place in your ``$GIT_DIR/hooks``
directory to trigger actions at certain points. The ``pre-commit`` hook is
useful for performing actions right before Git writes a commit.

Jig has a set of common plugins that will probably be useful to you
right now, but the real goal is to make it easy for you to write your own.

Jump straight to it
-------------------

* :doc:`Jig's command line tool <cli>`
* :doc:`Build Jig plugins <pluginapi>`

Install it
----------

The Jig command line tool is written in Python and is available on PyPi. ::

    $ pip install jig || easy_install jig

This is just a little shell trick that uses ``easy_install`` if it can't locate
``pip``.

Test drive
----------

Let's test this out first with a new repository. ::

    $ mkdir gitrepo; cd $_
    $ git init .

Create the root commit. Git repositories are not very useful without it.

::

    $ echo "Testing Jig" > README
    $ git add README; git commit -m 'First commit!'
    [master (root-commit) bc45fd3] First commit!
    1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    create mode 100644 README

Jig will create the ``pre-commit`` hook for you automatically.  It will also
create a ``.jig`` directory to hold configuration files. Just point it at a Git
repository and run this command:

::

    $ cd gitrepo
    $ jig init .
    Git repository has been initialized for use with Jig.

If you're curious, you can :ref:`see what this thing has done
<development-plumbing>` to your repository.

Jig uses "plugins" to do the real work. Your Jig config file (in
:file:`.jig/plugins.cfg`) is empty which means you have none installed.

::

    $ jig plugin add http://github.com/robmadole/jig-plugins
    Added plugin pep8-checker in bundle jig-plugins to the repository.
    Added plugin pyflakes in bundle jig-plugins to the repository.
    Added plugin whitespace in bundle jig-plugins to the repository.
    Added plugin whoops in bundle jig-plugins to the repository.

Let's test our pep8-checker. `PEP8`_ is an endorsed style guide for writing
Python code. Johann Rocholl `created a tool`_ that checks for compliance.

Create a new file and put all of our imports on one line. This is contrary to PEP8.

::

    $ echo "import this; import that; import other" > myapp.py

Jig only works off the files you've staged for a commit.

::

    $ git add myapp.py

See it in action
----------------

With our staged file, we're ready to commit.

::

    $ git commit -m 'Writing some hard to read Python code'
    ▾  pep8-checker

    ⚠  line 1: myapp.py
        import this; import that; import other
         - E702 multiple statements on one line (semicolon)

    Ran 1 plugin
        Info 0 Warn 1 Stop 0

    Commit anyway (hit enter), or "c" to cancel the commit

Jig isn't pushy. You can hit enter to commit anyway or :kbd:`c` cancels the
commit and gives you a chance to make changes.
